        <h2>What exactly do I get when I join?</h2>
        <p>
          You get a fully personalised training and nutrition program built around your
          goals, schedule, and current fitness level as a busy man. Your plan fits around
          work, social life, and family. Not the other way around.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also get weekly 1:1 check-ins, real accountability, and live adjustments
          based on your progress. You never have to guess what to do next.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          This is not a cookie-cutter app or 8-week challenge. This is your roadmap.

        <h2>Pre-Sales Call FAQ</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          These are the most common questions busy guys ask before they start coaching.
          Read through them so you show up to the call clear and ready.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-list">

          <details class="faq-item" open>
            <summary>How is this different from what I’ve already tried?</summary>
            <p>
              You have probably tried generic programs, PDF plans, or YouTube routines
              that treat everyone the same. They are built for “average people” and assume
              you have endless time and energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This coaching is different because everything is built around you:
              your job hours, stress levels, sleep, training history, food preferences,
              and current energy. We use your data each week to adjust.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              No more guessing. No more starting again on Monday.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do I need access to a gym or special equipment?</summary>
            <p>
              No. If you have a commercial gym, great. If you only have dumbbells,
              bands, or bodyweight at home, we build around that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many busy clients train in small windows of time at home or in a basic gym
              and still see serious results. The structure matters more than the equipment.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What if I’m too busy to follow the program?</summary>
            <p>
              Most clients are exactly where you are: full-time work, long days, mental
              fatigue, often a partner and social life on top.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire system is designed for busy men. Sessions are efficient, focused,
              and realistic. Nutrition is simplified and repeatable. You are not asked to
              train 6 days a week or meal prep for hours.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              The goal is to save you time and energy, not drain more of it.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What if I’ve tried other coaches and it did not work?</summary>
            <p>
              That is a common story. Many coaches hand you a recycled plan and disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, the coaching is built on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deep individualisation to your life and body</li>
              <li>Data and feedback every week</li>
              <li>Clear communication and honest expectations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you are coachable and follow the system, you will progress. We focus on
              long-term, sustainable change, not short-term hype.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Will I be hungry all the time or feel restricted?</summary>
            <p>
              No. You will be eating real food in real portions that suit your body and
              your lifestyle. No crash dieting, no tiny meals, no weird rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most busy guys are surprised at how much they can eat when the structure is
              right. The goal is controlled, sustainable progress, not suffering.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What happens if I fall off track?</summary>
            <p>
              Life happens. Work blows up, kids get sick, travel comes up. You will never
              be left on your own to “figure it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
              When things slip, we look at the week, identify what went wrong, adjust your
              plan, and move forward. No guilt. No lectures. Only strategy.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              Consistency beats perfection. You do not fail because you had one bad week.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>I am not sure I can afford it right now…</summary>
            <p>
              Fair question. The real question is: can you afford to stay where you are?
            </p>
            <p>
              Think about what low energy, low confidence, and poor health are costing you
              right now — in your work, relationships, and day-to-day life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coaching is not a random expense. It is an investment into a stronger,
              sharper version of you that shows up better in every area.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is there a guarantee?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. If you show up, follow the plan, communicate honestly, and stay
              coachable, and you do not get results, we will coach you for free until you do.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              The real risk is doing nothing and staying stuck for another year.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What kind of results have your clients seen?</summary>
            <p>
              Busy men have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dropped 10–20 kg of body fat</li>
              <li>Built lean muscle while working full-time</li>
              <li>Fixed low energy and afternoon crashes</li>
              <li>Regained confidence in and out of the gym</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You are not an exception. If they can do it with work and life commitments,
              so can you.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How do I know if I am the right fit?</summary>
            <p>
              This is for you if:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You are busy, but ready to take ownership</li>
              <li>You are tired of guesswork and random programs</li>
              <li>You want simple structure you can actually follow</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is not for you if you want a magic pill, shortcuts, or someone to
              blame when it gets hard.

        <h2>Before Our Call: Be Honest With Yourself</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Take 60 seconds to read these. If most of your answers are “no”, coaching is probably the right move.
        </p>
        <ul class="question-list">
          <li>Do you feel fully in control of your health, strength, and energy levels each week?</li>
          <li>Do you consistently follow a training and nutrition plan built specifically for your body and goals?</li>
          <li>Have you created the discipline to train without skipping or second-guessing yourself?</li>
          <li>Are you showing up every day as the strongest, most confident version of yourself?</li>
          <li>Do you feel proud of the way your body looks and performs right now?</li>
          <li>Do you wake up feeling rested and energised, not sluggish and drained?</li>
          <li>Do you feel confident taking your shirt off or seeing yourself in the mirror?</li>
          <li>Are your workouts actually moving you closer to the body and performance you want?</li>
          <li>Have you already achieved the transformation you promised yourself this year?</li>
          <li>Are you seeing steady, measurable progress every week in strength, physique, or energy?</li>
          <li>Do you know exactly what your body needs right now — and are you giving it that consistently?</li>
          <li>Do you believe your current routine is worth the time and effort you are putting into it?</li>
          <li>If nothing changes, are you comfortable being in the same shape and energy level a year from now?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">
          If the honest answer to most of these is “no”, that is exactly what we fix together.
